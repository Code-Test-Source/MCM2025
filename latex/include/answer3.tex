\subsection{Problem Analysis}
According to the reference:

Two possible examples of this include Lang Ping[2],
who coached volleyball teams from both the U.S. and China to championships, and the
sometimes-controversial gymnastics coach, Béla Károlyi[3], who coached Romania and
then the U.S. women’s teams with great success. 

Bela and Marta instructed the US gym team in the following years:

1981: They defected to the US and began coaching gymnastics soon after.

1984: They coached Mary Lou Retton, who won America's first gold medal in the Olympic all - arounds.

1991: They trained Kim Zmeskal, who became the world champion.

1996: Marta coached the "Magnificent Seven" member Kerri Strug to win the Olympic team gold.

2000: Bela was named national team coordinator.

2001 - 2016: Marta served as the coordinator of the US women's gymnastics national team.

Since there's too little data of Lang Ping, we decide to use Bela and Marta as an example to train data. We use comprehensive methods developed by previous tasks and establish the last part of our \textbf{`PRE'} model : \textbf{Legendary Index} .


\subsection{Model Establishment : Legendary Index}
We rearrange the data by Sport, NOC, and Sex. 

Since we do not have specific information on which events or disciplines Bela and Marta coached, we only consider sports, gender, and country. We assign a value of 1 if a great coach is coaching and 0 if not.Then we split the data into training, testing dataset and train our model by year according to specific parameters.Finally, We use the model to calculate Legendary Index to indicate greatness.

    for (sport, noc, sex), group in grouped_all_medal_counts:
        group['Legendary_Index'] = model.predict(group[['Year', 'Total', 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Bronze', 'No medal']])

\subsection{Lang Ping: The Great Coach}

Fortunatly, We've found Lang Ping in the Predicted Great Coach.

    \caption{Great Achievements Detected}
    \label{fig:lang_ping_combined}
\end{figure}

Besides Lang Ping, other great achievements are also detected. Although we don't have enough time to check every achievements with the information of the internet, every data we have checked is really great achievement.

Chinese Table Tennis and Gymnastics are selected as the most famous examples. 1996, 2000, 2008 and 2020 are great years for Chinese Male Table Tennis team, while 2024 is not although they got the gold medal.

We've even found interesting data of controversial results caused by the penalty awarded by referee.In 2024, Italy fencing is very close to greatness, and they've complained about the referee's decision.[4]

Coach of 2024 US female football team Emma Hayes is considered as great coach according to our model.She was named The Best FIFA Women's Coach of 2024.[5]

\subsection{Three Countries to invest in `great' coach}

From the data, three countries will benefit a lot from investing a 'great' coach.

China Tennis Male and Female 2024 : With rather great achievement, Chinese tennis team is close to greatness.However, it's not enough compared to it's past glory.Maybe changing the current coach is a good choice.

Korea Judo Male and Female 2024 : As an key event of Korea, it's not enough for them to stop their step. A great coach may lead them to greated achievements.

India Badminton Female 2024 : Only great athletes are not enough, they need great coach to fully show their potential. Although they are already creating new history, a great coach can lift them to higher places.

There're many Countries and Sports that need great coaches. Only three asian countries are chosen as an example to show that  great coach effect may help on different situation.

Besides, using the Legendary Index of our model, it's easier to discover potential great teams and athletes.We will discuss it's further application next chapter.
