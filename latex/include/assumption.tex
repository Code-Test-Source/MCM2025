\section{Assumptions and Justification}

To simplify the problem and make it convenient for us to simulate real-life conditions, we make the following basic assumptions, each of which is properly justified.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf The bath water is incompressible Non-Newtonian fluid}. The incompressible Non-Newtonian fluid is the basis of Navier–Stokes equations which are introduced to simulate the flow of bath water.

\item {\bf All the physical properties of bath water, bathtub and air are assumed to be stable}. The change of those properties like specific heat, thermal conductivity and density is rather small according to some studies \cite{5}. It is complicated and unnecessary to consider these little change so we ignore them.

\item {\bf There is no internal heat source in the system consisting of bathtub, hot water and air}. Before the person lies in the bathtub, no internal heat source exist except the system components. The circumstance where the person is in the bathtub will be investigated in our later discussion.

\item {\bf We ignore radiative thermal exchange}. According to Stefan-Boltzmann’s law, the radiative thermal exchange can be ignored when the temperature is low. Refer to industrial standard \cite{6}, the temperature in bathroom is lower than 100 $^{\circ}$C, so it is reasonable for us to make this assumption.

\item {\bf The temperature of the adding hot water from the faucet is stable}. This hypothesis can be easily achieved in reality and will simplify our process of solving the problem.
\end{itemize}
