\begin{letter}{Enjoy Your Bath Time!}

    From simulation results of real-life situations, we find it takes a period of time for the inflow hot water to spread throughout the bathtub. During this process, the bath water continues transferring heat into air, bathtub and the person in bathtub. The difference between heat transfer capacity makes the temperature of various areas to be different. So that it is difficult to get an evenly maintained temperature throughout the bath water.
    
    In order to enjoy a comfortable bath with even temperature of bath water and without wasting too much water, we propose the following suggestions.
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Adding hot water consistently
    \item Using smaller bathtub if possible
    \item Decreasing motions during bath
    \item Using bubble bath additives
    \item Arranging more faucets of inflow
    \end{itemize}
