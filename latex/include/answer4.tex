\section{Task II : Key Events}
\subsection{Key Events}
\subsubsection*{Calculation Methods}
To identify key events, we will use the proportion of medals from these events among the whole medal tally as a main factor.

From this graph, we can see that many countries rely on one or two sports/events for their medal tally. This can be inspiring for the countries' Olympics committees.
